It is a web site\r\nand a browser application which enable rich annotation of web content. The\r\nweb site acts as both a community and authentication end point as well as a\r\ndeployment host for the browser application.\r\n\r\nThe browser application is based substantially on work by the `Open Knowledge\r\nFoundation`_ on the `Annotator Project`_.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in `#hypothes.is`_ on freenode_.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHypothes.is currently requires several tools to build and run from scratch.\r\nIn the future, releases will include built versions of static assets for\r\nintegrators wanting to produce custom embeddings of the project on their\r\nown sites and the project welcomes packaging efforts to make including\r\nthe Hypothes.is service in any framework easy.\r\n\r\nThe project code itself is a pyramid_ application which can be integrated\r\ninto any WSGI_ compatible framework and run on any WSGI web server (such\r\nas gunicorn_ or uWSGI_). Until the project is ready for an alpha release,\r\nit may not be installable from the Python Package Index. Instead, the\r\napplication should be built in a virtual environment which can be set up as\r\nfollows::\r\n\r\n    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages .\r\n    $ source bin/activate\r\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nIf there is a failure installing PyYAML, install the libyaml development files.\r\n\r\nFor building the static assets, requirements currently include CoffeeScript_\r\n(needed by the Annotator), Sass_, Compass_ and Handlebars_. These dependencies\r\nshould be easily installable via common package management utilities.\r\n\r\nTo run an annotation storage backend elasticsearch_ is required.\r\n\r\nPlease see the platform-specific INSTALL files for additional assistance.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSee `#hypothes.is`_.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHypothes.is is released under the `2-Clause BSD License`_, sometimes referred\r\nto as the \"Simplified BSD License\" or the \"FreeBSD License\".
