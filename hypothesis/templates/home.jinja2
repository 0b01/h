    <h3>Imagine<span class="red">:</span></h3>
    <em>
      <p>If wherever we encountered new information, sentence by sentence,
        frame by frame, we could easily know the best thinking on it.</p>
      <p>If we had confidence that this represented the combined wisdom of
        the most informed people--not as anointed by editors, but as weighed over
        time by our peers, objectively, statistically and transparently.</p>
      <p>If this created a powerful incentive for people to ensure that their
        works met a higher standard, and made it perceptibly harder to spread
        information that didn't meet that standard.</p>
    </em>
    <p>These goals are possible with today's technologies.</p>
    <p>They are the objectives of Hypothes<span class="red">.</span>is.</p>

    <h3>Who are we<span class="red">?</span></h3>
    <p>Our work is the product of a broad collaboration between developers,
      designers, journalists, researchers, scientists and writers to create
      flexible and powerful tools for publishing, curating and navigating
      within the web of annotations.</p>
    <p>Central to the project is an open annotation directory, an experiment to
      create a solution for organizations and individuals to create and discover
      annotations on the open web. It includes an annotation client and storage
      API based on work from the
      <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> The storage server
      can output annotations in a variety of formats and includes rich semantic
      information conforming to the emerging
      <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation</a>
      specification.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>Soon you will be able to discover annotations of this page and to add
      your own. A sample set of annotations will guide you through the rest
      of this introduction.</p>
    <p>Hypothes<span class="red">.</span>is is a work in progress.</p>
