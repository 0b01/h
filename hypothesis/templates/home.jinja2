  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hypothes.is is a community of users and developers collaborating to create
    a new platform for productive conversation on the web. Our work is the result
    of a broad collaboration to develop flexible and powerful tools for
    publishing and discovering references in the web of annotations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Central to the project is an open annotation directory, an experiment to
    create a solution for organizations and individuals to create and organize
    annotations of content on the open web. It includes an annotation client
    based on work from the
    <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and a storage
    API for querying and updating annotations. The storage server can output
    annotations in a variety of formats and includes rich semantic information
    conforming to the emerging
    <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open Annotation</a> ontology.
  </p>
  <p>
    The annotation directory is a work in progress.
  </p>
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>
    Soon you will be able to discover annotations of this page and to add
    your own. A sample set of annotations will guide you through the rest
    of this introduction.
