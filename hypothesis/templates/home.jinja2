    <p>If wherever we encountered new information, sentence by sentence,
    frame by frame, we could easily know the best thinking on it.</p>
    <p>If we had confidence that this represented the combined wisdom of
    the most informed people--not as anointed by editors, but as weighed over
    time by our peers, objectively, statistically and transparently.</p>
    <p>If this created a powerful incentive for people to ensure that their works met a higher standard, and made it perceptibly harder to spread information that didn't meet that standard.</p>

These goals are possible with today's technologies.

They are the objectives of Hypothes.is. 
    <p> We are a community of users and developers collaborating to create a new
    platform for meaningful conversation on the Internet. Our work is the product
    of a broad collaboration between journalists, scientists, researchers and
    writers to develop flexible and powerful tools for publishing and
    discovering references in the web of annotations. </p>

    <p>Central to the project is an open annotation directory, an experiment to
    create a solution for organizations and individuals to create and organize
    annotations of content on the open web. It includes an annotation client
    based on work from the
    <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and a storage
    API for querying and updating annotations. The storage server can output
    annotations in a variety of formats and includes rich semantic information
    conforming to the emerging
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/">Open Annotation</a>
    ontology.</p>

    <p>The annotation directory is a work in progress.</p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p> Soon you will be able to discover annotations of this page and to add
    your own. A sample set of annotations will guide you through the rest
    of this introduction.</p>
