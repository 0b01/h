      <h3>Imagine<span class="red">:</span></h3>
      <em>
        <p>If wherever we encountered new information, sentence by sentence,
          frame by frame, we could easily know the best thinking on it.</p>
        <p>If we had confidence that this represented the combined wisdom of
          the most informed people â€“ not as anointed by editors, but as
          weighed over time by our peers, objectively, statistically and
          transparently.</p>
        <p>If this created a powerful incentive for people to ensure that their
          works met a higher standard, and made it perceptibly harder to spread
          information that didn't meet that standard.</p>
      </em>
      <p>These goals are possible with today's technologies.</p>
      <p>They are the objectives of Hypothes<span class="red">.</span>is.</p>

      <h3>Who are we<span class="red">?</span></h3>
      <p>Our work is the product of a broad collaboration between developers,
        designers, journalists, researchers, scientists and writers to create
        flexible and powerful tools for publishing, curating and navigating
        within the web of annotations.</p>
      <p>Central to the project is an open annotation directory, an experiment to
        create a solution for organizations and individuals to create and
        discover annotations on the open web. It includes an annotation client
        and storage API based on work from the
        <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> The storage
        server can output annotations in a variety of formats and includes rich
        semantic information conforming to the emerging
        <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation</a>
        specification.</p>

      <h3>Getting started</h3>
      <p>Soon you will be able to discover annotations of this page and to add
        your own. A sample set of annotations will guide you through the rest
        of this introduction.</p>
      <p>Hypothes<span class="red">.</span>is is a work in progress.</p>
